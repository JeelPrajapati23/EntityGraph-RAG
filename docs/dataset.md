# Dataset notes

## Scope

- **Ecosystem:** npm only for the MVP. npm trees are denser and deeper than
  PyPI's, which suits a multi-hop demo. Cross-ecosystem support (and aliasing
  the same library across ecosystems) is a stated future improvement, not
  an MVP requirement.
- **Corpus:** 20 pinned root packages. See
  [`config/projects.yaml`](../config/projects.yaml). The mix covers large
  build tooling (react-scripts, @vue/cli-service, @angular/cli, next),
  mid-size test runners and servers, and a few small trees (axios,
  jsonwebtoken) where a vulnerable path can be checked by hand.

## Why pinned, date-bounded trees

A tree resolved today pulls the latest patched version of every transitive
dependency, so most historical vulnerabilities disappear from it. Each root
is instead resolved with `npm install --package-lock-only --before=<date>`,
using the day after the root's own release. This gives the tree a real
project would have installed then. The resolution is reproducible and
needs no custom resolver.

Spot checks done while choosing the corpus (2026-09-23):

| Root | Resolved transitive dep | Known advisory |
|---|---|---|
| `axios@0.21.1` | `follow-redirects@1.13.1` | CVE-2022-0155 (fixed 1.14.7) |
| `express@4.17.1` | `qs@6.7.0` | CVE-2022-24999 (fixed 6.7.3) |
| `express@4.17.1` | `path-to-regexp@0.1.7` | CVE-2024-45296 (fixed 0.1.10) |

`react-scripts@4.0.3` resolves to ~1,900 packages in ~70 s.

## Gotcha for Phase 1/2: lockfile nesting is not dependency depth

npm hoists packages, so in `package-lock.json` the `node_modules/…`
nesting is at most 2–3 levels even for deep trees. Logical `DEPENDS_ON`
edges have to be rebuilt from each entry's own `dependencies` map, using
Node's resolution rule: look in the nearest `node_modules` first, then walk
up. The path segments alone don't give the edges.

## Data sources

| Data | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency trees | `npm install --package-lock-only --before` | Deterministic. Produces `DEPENDS_ON` edges and declared ranges |
| Vulnerabilities | [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) `/v1/querybatch` + `/v1/vulns/{id}` | Structured ranges plus free-text `details` for LLM extraction |
| Maintainers, license, publish time, deprecation | `registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>` | Maintainer emails are dropped and only usernames are kept |

Every fetched record goes into a `manifest.jsonl` with package, ecosystem,
version, source URL and fetch time, so every edge can point back to the
record it came from.

## Acquisition (Phase 1)

```bash
uv run python scripts/fetch_lockfiles.py     # → data/raw/lockfiles/<slug>/package-lock.json
uv run python scripts/fetch_osv.py           # → data/raw/osv/{vulns/<id>.json, package_vulns.jsonl}
uv run python scripts/fetch_npm_metadata.py  # → data/raw/npm/packuments/<name>.json
```

All three are incremental and write a `manifest.jsonl` next to their
output. Re-running only fetches what's new or changed (`--refresh` forces a
full fetch). The OSV and registry scripts read the lockfile manifest, so
run the lockfile script first.

**First full run (2026-09-23):**

| | |
|---|---|
| Lockfiles | 20 roots, 2–1,936 installed packages each |
| Unique package versions / names | 2,466 / 1,746 |
| Package versions with ≥1 advisory | 220 |
| Advisories | 296 (295 GHSA, 1 MAL). 285 have a CVE alias |
| Severity | 28 critical, 134 high, 106 moderate, 27 low, 1 unlabeled |
| Disk | lockfiles 2.9 MB, trimmed packuments 16 MB, advisories 2.1 MB |

Every root has at least one advisory in its tree. Counts range from 5
(`jsonwebtoken`) to 177 (`react-scripts`). For `axios@0.21.1` there are 24
advisories on axios itself and 5 on `follow-redirects@1.13.1`, the
transitive dependency the plan's example uses.

`package_vulns.jsonl` is OSV's own server-side matching of each package
version to advisories. It is **not** graph input: `HAS_VULNERABILITY` is
derived by our own semver matcher in Phase 3/4. It is kept as ground truth
to test that matcher against.

**Things found during the first run:**

- **Malicious-package advisories.** OSV includes OpenSSF `MAL-` records
  alongside GHSA ones. The one hit is `MAL-2023-462`: `fsevents` 1.x
  downloaded binaries from a storage bucket that was later taken over, and
  `fsevents@1.2.9` is in a corpus tree. MAL records have no GHSA severity
  label, and their `details` text is templated incident boilerplate rather
  than an exploit description, so Phase 3's condition extraction should
  skip them.
- **OSV `modified` precision differs by endpoint.** `/v1/querybatch` returns
  microseconds and `/v1/vulns/{id}` returns nanoseconds. The cache check
  compares at microsecond precision (`reachfix.npm.osv.normalize_modified`).
- **npm fetch timeout.** npm's default 5-minute fetch timeout let one stalled
  registry socket hang `browser-sync` for minutes. `fetch_lockfiles.py`
  passes `--fetch-timeout=60000 --fetch-retries=4`.

## Ingestion (Phase 2)

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_dependency_edges.py  # → data/processed/depgraph/{dependency_edges,unresolved_dependencies}.jsonl
uv run python scripts/build_advisory_chunks.py   # → data/processed/depgraph/advisory_chunks.jsonl
```

Both read the Phase 1 manifests and fully rewrite their output each run.
Outputs go under `data/processed/depgraph/`.

**Dependency edges** (`reachfix.npm.dependencies`). For each
dependency an installed package declares, the resolver finds the copy
Node would load: `<pkg>/node_modules/<dep>` first, then each enclosing
`node_modules` up to the top. Each edge carries:

- `version_range` (npm-alias prefix stripped) and the verbatim
  `declared_spec`
- `dependency_type`: prod / optional / peer
- `lockfile_doc_ids`, plus `occurrences`, which lists the install paths
  in every lockfile
- `registry_check` against the registry's declared dependencies for that
  version: match / range_differs / type_differs / not_declared /
  no_registry_data

The registry lists optional deps under both `dependencies` and
`optionalDependencies`, and a lockfile lists them only under the latter.
`registry.declared_dependencies` does the same split before the two are
compared.

**First run (2026-09-23):**

| | |
|---|---|
| Declared deps | 11,363 across 20 lockfiles, 11,328 resolved |
| Version-level edges | 5,983 (5,687 prod, 269 peer, 27 optional) |
| Registry cross-check | all 5,983 `match`. The registry declares no dep that a lockfile entry omits |
| Unresolved | 35, all peers: 27 marked optional in `peerDependenciesMeta`, and 8 required `react`/`react-dom` peers in the `next` tree (`--legacy-peer-deps` does not install peers) |
| Reachability | every installed package in every lockfile is reachable from its root |
| Advisory chunks | 383 from 295 advisories (55 split). Median 157 words. `MAL-2023-462` skipped |

**Gotcha: version-level edges can merge different install paths.** A
version installed at two paths can resolve the same dependency to two
different versions. The one case in the corpus is `http-errors@1.6.3` in
`browser-sync`, which gets `statuses@1.5.0` under `serve-index/` and
`statuses@1.4.0` under `send/`. Both edges are correct, but a version-level
traversal can combine them into a path no install actually has. Edges are
also merged across lockfiles, so traversals from one root should follow
only edges whose `lockfile_doc_ids` include that root's lockfile. Where
exact paths matter, `occurrences` has them.

**Advisory chunks** (`reachfix.npm.advisory`). `details` is
markdown. It is split into paragraphs at blank lines (never inside a
fenced code block), and the paragraphs are packed into chunks of at most
450 words. Packing runs across headings, and each heading stays glued to
the paragraph after it. The first attempt split at every heading instead,
which gave 1,026 chunks, many of them two-line "Patches" sections. Chunk
ids are `<osv_id>::<index>`, and each chunk carries `source_url` (the
osv.dev page), `aliases`, `summary`, `severity`, `modified`,
`affected_packages` and the `sections` it spans. A single block over 450
words (one 802-word PoC) is kept whole rather than cut.

## Extraction (Phase 3)

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_vulnerability_edges.py  # → data/processed/depgraph/vulnerability_edges.jsonl
uv run python scripts/extract_conditions.py [--limit N] [--ids GHSA-…]  # → exploit_conditions.jsonl (Groq)
```

**Deterministic and derived edges** (`reachfix.npm.vulnerabilities`,
`npm.versions`). `AFFECTS_VERSION_RANGE` and `FIXED_IN` come straight
from OSV's `affected` field, npm entries only. `HAS_VULNERABILITY` is
computed by our own matcher: OSV `SEMVER` events are evaluated per the
OSV spec, with `node-semver` (a Python port of npm's `semver`) doing the
comparisons. Withdrawn advisories get no `HAS_VULNERABILITY` edges.

| | |
|---|---|
| Edges | 328 `AFFECTS_VERSION_RANGE` (one per advisory and package, from 570 OSV `affected` entries), 551 `FIXED_IN` (26 fix targets are in some tree), 556 `HAS_VULNERABILITY` |
| vs OSV's own matches (`package_vulns.jsonl`) | 556 agree, 0 only ours, 0 only OSV's |
| `DEPENDS_ON` range check | 5,982 of 5,983 resolved versions satisfy their declared range. The one exception is a peer: `@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin` wants `type-fest@^0.13.1` and `--legacy-peer-deps` left 0.11.0 |

The range check is stored on each dependency edge as `range_satisfied`.

**LLM extraction of `EXPLOITABLE_WHEN`** (`reachfix.conditions`).
The prompt and output model are generated from the schema's `llm` edges
only. `ExploitCondition.category` has a closed vocabulary in
`schema/v2.yaml` (`property_values`), which becomes a `Literal` type. Each
condition must quote its `evidence` from the chunk. A quote that isn't
found in the chunk text or summary gets the condition dropped. The match
ignores case, whitespace and markdown punctuation, and quotes of 6+ words
may match fuzzily at ≥95. Each edge records `evidence_match: exact|fuzzy`.

Prompt revisions, from a 9-advisory sample (one revision only, to avoid
tuning the prompt to a small set):

- Conditions must describe the victim application or its environment,
  never an attacker's step. The first version returned things like "the
  attack payload is placed in the query string".
- PoC code shows attacker steps. The first version pulled
  "conditions" out of axios PoC code.
- The evidence check originally failed on markdown link brackets and on a
  dropped "the", which lost two true conditions.

**Full run (2026-09-23):** all 383 chunks, spread over 8 rotated Groq
keys (see `llm_client.RotatingGroq`). The free tier's 200K tokens/day per
key covers ~73 chunks, at ~2.3K tokens each.

| | |
|---|---|
| Conditions | 637 on 263 of 295 advisories. 32 advisories state no precondition |
| Evidence | 631 exact matches, 6 fuzzy, 15 dropped as not found in the text |
| Category | 279 `input_source`, 145 `configuration`, 104 `api_usage`, 59 `other`, 50 `platform` |

Spot checks look right on the whole: "the application extracts
attacker-controlled tar archives", "the application calls `setIn` with
data derived from a request". There's some noise too, e.g. "express must
not redirect before the template appears". There's no labeled set yet to
measure precision. That belongs to the evaluation phase. Re-running
resumes from the cache (`.cache/conditions/`, keyed on prompt + chunk +
model + schema version).

## Resolution (Phase 4)

```bash
uv run python scripts/resolve_nodes.py  # → nodes.jsonl, registry_edges.jsonl, condition_edges.jsonl
```

npm names and versions are already canonical, so this phase gives every
node one id and checks that every edge endpoint resolves to one
(`reachfix.npm.nodes`).

- **Ids.** `npm:<name>` for a Package, `npm:<name>@<version>` for a
  PackageVersion, the OSV id for a Vulnerability, `npm-user:<username>`,
  `license:<id>`, and `<osv_id>::cond::<n>` for an ExploitCondition.
- **PackageVersion** covers every tree version plus every `FIXED_IN`
  target (`in_tree: false`), with `is_root`, `published_at`,
  `deprecated` and `lockfile_doc_ids`.
- **Registry edges:** `VERSION_OF`, `MAINTAINED_BY` (current maintainers
  only; the registry keeps no history) and `LICENSED_UNDER`. An SPDX
  expression like `(MIT OR CC0-1.0)` gives one edge per license, each
  carrying the full expression and operator. Two legacy spellings are
  mapped (`Apache 2.0`, `AFLv2.1`). `BSD` names no single SPDX license
  and is kept as is rather than guessed.
- **ExploitCondition nodes** merge near-duplicate conditions within one
  advisory (token_sort_ratio ≥ 90), since multi-chunk advisories restate
  them. Conditions are never merged across advisories.

**First run (2026-09-23):** 6,460 nodes (1,765 Package, 2,905
PackageVersion, 296 Vulnerability, 844 Maintainer, 19 License, 631
ExploitCondition merged from 637 extracted conditions). 17,944 edges, 0
dangling endpoints. 122 tree versions are deprecated.

**Gotcha: one CVE can belong to several advisories.** Six CVE ids are
aliases of two advisories each, for example `CVE-2024-45296` on
`GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j` and `GHSA-37ch-88jc-xwx2` (path-to-regexp). These
are an advisory and its incomplete-fix follow-up. They list each other
as aliases but have different ranges: 0.1.x is "fixed" in 0.1.10 by one
and in 0.1.13 by the other. They stay separate nodes, because a merged
node would have an ambiguous `FIXED_IN`. `NodeLookup` resolves a CVE to
every advisory that lists it, and Phase 9 remediation must take the
highest fix across all of them.

**Query-time lookup** (`reachfix.npm.lookup.NodeLookup`). An
advisory id resolves to itself. A CVE resolves to every advisory aliasing
it. `name@version` resolves to that PackageVersion. A package name
matches case-insensitively, then fuzzily with `-_./` treated alike
(`follow redirects` → `follow-redirects`). Names are not stripped of
words like "co" or "group", which are real npm package names.

## Graph construction (Phase 5)

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_depgraph.py  # → data/processed/depgraph/graph.pkl
```

The graph lives in `NetworkXGraphStore` (behind the `GraphStore`
interface). `upsert_edge` accepts:
- provenance fields are optional, and `confidence` defaults to 1.0 for
  deterministic and derived edges
- an edge can bring a `provenance` list and a `properties` dict

`reachfix.npm.graph_load` maps DepGraph rows onto that shape. A
`DEPENDS_ON` edge's provenance lists every lockfile it occurs in, plus the
registry packument when `registry_check` is `match`. That is the plan's
"one fact from a lockfile and a registry cross-check, both kept as
provenance". A merged `EXPLOITABLE_WHEN` edge keeps one provenance entry
per source chunk, with its evidence quote.

**Edge collision fixed at the source.** OSV lists a package once per
release line (`minimatch` has 8 `affected` entries in one advisory).
These now become one `AFFECTS_VERSION_RANGE` edge per (advisory, package)
carrying all the ranges. Before, they would have silently merged in the
store, keeping only the first entry's ranges.

**Traversal** (`reachfix.graph.exposure`, written against
`GraphStore` only):
- `dependency_paths` does a breadth-first walk over `DEPENDS_ON`,
  following only edges whose `lockfile_doc_ids` include the chosen
  lockfile.
- `exposure` returns every reachable (vulnerable version, advisory) with
  its shortest path.
- `exposed_lockfiles` lists the projects affected by one advisory.

**First build (2026-09-23):** 6,460 nodes, 17,944 edges.

- **Reachability:** for all 20 lockfiles, a lockfile-scoped walk from the
  root reaches exactly the versions that lockfile installs. The check
  reads the raw lockfiles, independently of the graph.
- **Exposure:** per-root advisory counts match Phase 1 (177 for
  react-scripts, 5 for jsonwebtoken).
- **Depth:** trees go deeper than the plan's "4–6 levels". Max depth is
  3–11 hops, and the deepest vulnerable version is 9 hops from its root
  (`json-schema@0.2.3` under react-scripts, `ansi-regex@3.0.0` under
  @angular/cli).
- **Demo path:** `npm:axios@0.21.1 -> depends_on ->
  npm:follow-redirects@1.13.1 [VULNERABLE: GHSA-74fj-2j2h-c42q /
  CVE-2022-0155]`.

## Semantic retrieval (Phase 6)

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_advisory_index.py [--variant NAME | --all]  # → advisory_index_<variant>.*
uv run python scripts/search_advisories.py "slow regex on crafted input" [--package lodash]
uv run python scripts/eval_advisory_retrieval.py                          # compares the built variants
```

Retrieval is `VectorIndex` (brute-force cosine), `embed_chunks` and a
content-keyed embedding cache. The interesting part is what gets embedded.

**Silent truncation.** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` reads 256 word-pieces, and the
HF endpoint drops the rest without an error. The 802-word chunk embeds
identically (cosine 1.0) to its first 150 words. 202 of 383 chunks are
over 150 words. 31 chunks never name their own package in the text.

**Longer-context models.** Tested for availability on the HF endpoint and
for how much text they actually read (embedding of the full chunk vs its
first N words):
- bge-small/base/large-en-v1.5, all-mpnet-base-v2, mxbai-embed-large-v1
  and snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5 are all saturated by 300 words
  (512-token models).
- `BAAI/bge-m3` (8192 tokens, 1024-dim) keeps reading past 600 words, so
  it embeds each chunk whole.
- e5-base-v2, nomic-embed-text, jina-v2, gte-base and Qwen3-Embedding
  aren't served for feature extraction.

**Variants** (`reachfix.npm.advisory_index`):
- `minilm_whole`: the raw chunk, silently truncated (the baseline)
- `minilm_windowed`: ~110-word windows overlapping by 20 words, each
  prefixed with the advisory's summary and packages. Search rolls window
  hits up to their parent chunk (`retrieval/windows.py`).
- `bge_m3_whole`: the whole chunk with the same prefix

**Evaluation** (`scripts/eval_advisory_retrieval.py`). There are no
hand-labeled judgments, so it uses facts already in the data:
- 31 package queries ("what security vulnerabilities has <pkg> had?").
  Relevant means OSV's `affected` lists the package.
- 8 paraphrased vulnerability-class queries. Relevant means the advisory
  text matches a pattern whose words the query avoids.

precision@5 over distinct advisories:

| Variant | Package queries | Class queries |
|---|---|---|
| `minilm_whole` | 0.626 | 0.725 |
| `minilm_windowed` | 0.735 | **0.775** |
| `bge_m3_whole` | **0.761** | 0.675 |

Windowing plus the prefix beats the truncated baseline on both sets.
bge-m3 edges ahead on package queries but falls behind on class queries
(it scored 0.40 on XSS, where both MiniLM variants scored 1.00). Package
questions mostly take the hybrid route, where the graph already limits
results to that package's advisories. So the semantic route mainly
serves class-style questions, and **`minilm_windowed` is the default**.
Eight class queries is a small sample, so the gap between the variants
is indicative, not conclusive. SSRF is weak for every variant (0.00–0.20;
only 3% of advisories are SSRF).

The HF endpoint returned an occasional 502, so `embed_texts` now retries
5xx, timeouts and dropped connections with backoff (not 4xx).

## Hybrid router (Phase 7)

```bash
uv run python scripts/route_depgraph.py "Is axios@0.21.1 exposed to CVE-2022-0155?"  # one question, what it retrieved
uv run python scripts/eval_depgraph_router.py                                          # eval/depgraph_questions.yaml
```

Generic `neighbors`/`two_hop`/`common_neighbors` graph patterns can't
express "exposed through a dependency 9 hops deep in this project's
lockfile", so the router has domain patterns. Its shape: one Groq classification call,
Literal types generated from the schema, one retry, then a fall-back to
semantic search, and a plain `if`/`elif` dispatch.

- **Routes:** `semantic` (advisory text, no named entity), `relational`
  (a graph fact about named entities) and `graph_guided_hybrid` (named
  entities, answer from advisory text).
- **Relational patterns:**
  - `exposure`: a project's vulnerable dependencies, optionally for a
    named CVE, with paths
  - `affected_projects`: which projects an advisory reaches
  - `dependency_path`: how a project pulls in a package
  - `neighbors`: one relation such as `FIXED_IN`, `MAINTAINED_BY`,
    `EXPLOITABLE_WHEN` or `LICENSED_UNDER`
- **Hybrid** gets its advisory set from the graph, then ranks only those
  advisories' chunks. A package name means the advisories affecting it. A
  version means every advisory in its dependency tree.
- **Walks are lockfile-scoped.** A corpus root walks its own lockfile. A
  non-root version walks each lockfile it is installed in. A bare package
  name means its root versions, else all its in-tree versions.
- Each result records the classified route, the route that actually ran
  (it falls back to semantic when no named entity resolves), how each
  entity resolved, and warnings.

**Question set (`eval/depgraph_questions.yaml`, 20 questions).** Expected
routes are hand-set. The `expect` checks are read off the graph instead of
being hand-judged: exact paths, advisory ids, nodes. First run
(2026-09-23, `minilm_windowed` index): route 19/20 and route + pattern
19/20. Checks passed 19/20 and 18/20 were fully correct. That includes the
9-hop `react-scripts → … → json-schema@0.2.3` path, all five
jsonwebtoken advisories, and the three spot-checked projects for
CVE-2022-24999.

- `nb-03` "Under what conditions is CVE-2023-26136 exploitable?" was
  routed to hybrid (advisory text) instead of the `EXPLOITABLE_WHEN` edge.
  That's a defensible reading.
- `hyb-04` "…the follow-redirects vulnerability in axios 0.21.1…": the
  classifier extracted only `axios@0.21.1`, so the search was scoped to
  axios's whole tree and ranked axios's own advisories first. That's an
  entity-extraction miss.

The prompt was not tuned to fix either one. The set is small, and tuning
a prompt to it trades one question for another (overfitting).

## Answer synthesis (Phase 8)

```bash
uv run python scripts/ask_depgraph.py "Is axios@0.21.1 exposed to CVE-2022-0155?"  # answer + chains + osv.dev links
uv run python scripts/eval_depgraph_router.py --answers                           # routing + answer checks
```

`reachfix.depgraph.synthesis` keeps three things apart. The evidence
given to the model is not the preview shown to the reader.

- **Evidence for the model.** Graph facts `[G#]` are readable chains in
  the plan's form (`axios@0.21.1 → depends_on → follow-redirects@1.13.1
  [VULNERABLE: GHSA-74fj-2j2h-c42q / CVE-2022-0155, HIGH]`), with fixed
  versions. Advisory chunks `[A#]` come with their full text.
- **Exact totals, computed by the router, never by the model.** They are
  counted over every result row before the router's 200-row cap. Facts
  are capped at 40 and ranked worst severity first.
- **The citation block returned to the caller.** It has every chain,
  every advisory with its osv.dev URL, and chunk previews.

After generation, every CVE/GHSA/MAL id in the answer must appear in the
evidence (otherwise it's flagged as ungrounded), and every `[G#]`/`[A#]`
marker must point at evidence that exists.

**Bugs found on real answers:**
- **Wrong totals.** The first react-scripts answer reported 162
  advisories instead of 177, because totals were computed after the
  router capped rows by depth. Totals now come from the router, over all
  rows, and the cap keeps the most severe rows.
- **Truncated answer.** The model listed every advisory and was cut off
  mid-id. It now lists at most 10 and summarizes the rest from the totals.
- **Blind id check.** The model wrote ids with non-breaking hyphens
  (U+2011), citations in full-width brackets `【G1】`, zero-width spaces
  inside markers, and `jws @ 3.2.2`. Any of these makes the checks miss
  what they're looking for. The answer is normalized before checking and
  display (dashes are left alone).
- **False "ungrounded".** Neighbor facts named an advisory by GHSA id
  only, so a correct "CVE-2022-0155 is fixed in 1.14.7" was flagged.
  Neighbor results now carry the advisory's aliases.

**Routing gap closed in dispatch, not in the prompt.** "Which projects
pull in a follow-redirects vulnerable to GHSA-74fj…?" was sometimes
classified as `exposure`. But exposure walks down from a project, and a
bare dependency name isn't one, so the answer claimed no project was
affected. When `exposure` names an advisory but only packages that aren't
corpus roots, dispatch now runs `affected_projects` for those packages
and says so in a warning. Results record both the classified `pattern`
and the `executed_pattern`, so the eval still charges the classifier for
the miss.

**Eval (20 questions, `eval/results/depgraph_answers.json`):**
- Answers: 20/20 grounded (no invented ids or markers) and 20/20 cite
  evidence. 18/20 mention every expected fact. The two misses are
  phrasing: the right fact, cited, written differently, e.g. naming the
  vulnerable package without its version.
- Routing: 17/20 fully correct. Classification varies a little between
  runs even at temperature 0 (aff-02 came back as `exposure` in two of
  three runs).

## Remediation (Phase 9)

`npm/remediation.py` plans the smallest upgrade that removes one
vulnerable copy from one lockfile. `scripts/build_remediation.py` plans
every (lockfile, vulnerable version) pair. The router's `remediation`
pattern plans the copies a question points at, at query time.

**What "fixed" means.** Candidates are published stable versions newer
than the installed one and outside every *target* advisory's OSV ranges.
The targets are the advisories on the copy (or the ones the question
names) plus every advisory on the package that shares a CVE with one of
them. So an advisory and its incomplete-fix follow-up are fixed together,
and the highest fix wins. Candidates clear of *every* known advisory on
the package come first, then non-deprecated ones, then the lowest.
Because of this ranking, 15 of 479 plans target a version above the
lowest fixed one. Example: lodash 4.18.0 fixes the targets but loses to
4.18.1.

**Statuses** (per copy, against the declared ranges of its dependents in
that lockfile):

| status | meaning | count |
|---|---|---|
| `in_range` | one fixed version satisfies every dependent's range: `npm update <name>` | 274 |
| `blocked` | some dependent's range excludes every fixed version | 179 |
| `no_fix` | no published version is outside the advisory ranges | 18 |
| `upgrade_root` | the vulnerable copy is the project itself | 8 |
| `split` | every range admits a fixed version, but no single one fits all | 0 |

**Blocked dependents are upgraded, repeating toward the root.** For each
blocker, the planner takes the lowest newer release whose declared range
admits a fixed version, or that no longer declares the dependency. It
then checks that release against the blocker's own dependents, and
repeats. Releases admitting one of the child's best-ranked fixed versions
come first, so the ranking above carries up the chain: for CVE-2024-45296
the planner picks express 4.22.0 (`path-to-regexp ~0.1.12`, admits
0.1.13, clear of every known advisory) over 4.20.0 (`0.1.10`, still hit by
GHSA-rhx6-c78j-4q9w). 161 of 179 blocked plans end with an upgrade path
for every blocker. 125 of those need a project-root upgrade, e.g. mocha
8.4.0 pins `minimatch` to exactly `3.0.4`, and mocha 10.6.0 is the first
release declaring a fixed range (`^5.1.6`). An npm `overrides` entry is
always given as the fallback, flagged as forcing a version outside a
declared range.

**No fix is not a dead end.** 17 of 18 `no_fix` copies (`request`,
`ip@1.x`, `elliptic`, `parseuri`, `html-minifier`, `extract-zip`) can be
removed by upgrading their dependents to releases that drop them. For
example, jsdom 16.6.0 is the first release without `request`, and it fits
`jest-environment-jsdom`'s `^16.4.0`. The one left over is `request@2.88.2`
in its own lockfile, where there is nothing above it.

**Release metadata.** Asking what a *newer* parent release declares needs
manifests the trimmed packuments don't keep (they have manifests only for
corpus versions). `scripts/fetch_release_metadata.py` plans everything,
fetches the packages the plans found missing, and repeats until nothing is
missing. The first run took 6 rounds (260 → 20 → 10 → 8 → 1 → 0) and
fetched 322 packages (`data/raw/npm/releases/`, 15 MB).
`build_remediation.py` then writes the 328 packages the plans read to
`data/processed/depgraph/releases.json` (16 MB), which the router loads.

**Gotchas:**
- **"Safe" means safe against the advisories in this dataset.** OSV was
  queried for corpus versions (Phase 1), so an advisory that affects only
  releases newer than anything in a tree is missing. A fix target can be
  vulnerable to it.
- **The registry isn't pinned here.** Trees are resolved `--before` a date,
  but remediation reads the registry as fetched, because a fix is for
  today. Plan versions (and `eval/depgraph_questions.yaml`'s `remediation`
  expectations) can change after `fetch_release_metadata.py --refresh`.
- **It is greedy, not a solver.** Each blocker's chain is planned on its
  own, and versions are merged per package (highest wins). Intermediate
  upgrades are shown as minimums ("html-webpack-plugin 3.2.0 -> >= 4.1.0"),
  because the upgraded root may require more (@vue/cli-service 5.0.1
  declares `^5.1.0`).
- **Monorepos pin each other exactly, with cycles.** jest 26's packages
  declare `^26.6.3` / `26.6.3` on each other, and jest-runner → jest-config
  → @jest/test-sequencer → jest-runner is a cycle. Fixing `braces` in
  jest@26.6.3 walks ~15 packages up to jest 27. The depth limit is 25, and
  sub-plans are memoized per (dependent, dependency, child candidates). A
  blocker that is already being upgraded lower in the same chain is
  assumed to move with it and listed as "unchecked". 15 of the 178
  resolved blocked/no-fix plans rely on such an assumption.
- **The planner's text output is flattened.** The raw plan is a tree, one
  branch per blocker, and jest's is hundreds of lines. `actions()` merges it
  into: project upgrades, lockfile refreshes, upgrades that come along,
  unchecked or unresolved blockers, and the override. Lists are capped
  (`MAX_LISTED`). Synthesis also shows at most 12 plans
  (`MAX_REMEDIATION_FACTS`). A project-wide question over react-scripts
  otherwise built a 15K-token prompt, above Groq's free-tier 8K
  tokens/minute.
- **A dependency that is also a corpus root must be named second.** In
  "how can react-scripts drop request?", `request@2.88.2` is itself a root.
  The first named root is the project, and later names narrow which
  dependencies to fix.

**Grounding check for versions.** A remediation answer's main risk is a
plausible but invented version. Answers are now also checked for
`name@version` mentions whose name and version never appear together in
one evidence line (`ungrounded_versions`). The eval counts these as
ungrounded.

**Eval (24 questions; 4 new `rem-*`):**
- Router (`eval/results/depgraph_router.json`): 21/24 fully correct.
  nb-03 and hyb-04 were already misses in Phase 8. aff-02 came back as
  `exposure` once, and dispatch still answered it as `affected_projects`.
  Rerun alone it was `affected_projects` 3 of 3 times, with both the old
  and the new prompt. All 4 remediation questions route and plan
  correctly.
- Answers (`eval/results/depgraph_answers.json`, a separate run): 23/24
  routed fully correct, 23/24 grounded, 24/24 cite evidence. The
  ungrounded one is sem-04 (semantic route), which named
  GHSA-5qq5-rm4j-mr97, an advisory that isn't in the dataset. No answer
  had an ungrounded version. All 4 remediation answers are grounded and
  name the expected fix.

## Schema

See [`schema/v2.yaml`](../schema/v2.yaml). Key decisions:

- **Two-level package identity** (`Package` name vs. `PackageVersion`),
  like deps.dev and GUAC. Trees and exposure are about versions.
  Maintainers and advisory ranges are about names.
- **Each edge type declares its extraction method.** Only
  `EXPLOITABLE_WHEN` (advisory text → `ExploitCondition`) is LLM-extracted.
  `HAS_VULNERABILITY` is *derived* by semver-matching tree versions
  against OSV ranges. Everything else is deterministic ground truth.
- **`DEPENDS_ON` keeps the declared range**, not only the resolved
  version. Phase 9 remediation needs it to check whether a fixed version
  satisfies every dependent's constraint.
- **CVE ids are aliases.** npm advisories are keyed by GHSA id, so a query
  naming a CVE resolves through `Vulnerability.aliases`.
