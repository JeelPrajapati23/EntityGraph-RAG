"""LLM query classification for the DepGraph router.

The output model's Literal types come from the schema, so the classifier
can't propose an edge type outside schema/v2.yaml. The graph patterns are
built for dependency questions, which need lockfile-scoped, many-hop
traversal (graph/exposure.py) rather than fixed one- or two-hop lookups.

    return f"""You route questions for a retrieval system about npm dependency \
trees and security advisories. It has two mechanisms: a knowledge graph \
(package versions, their resolved dependencies, advisories and which \
versions they affect, fixed versions, maintainers, licenses, exploit \
conditions) and a vector index over advisory text.

Pick exactly one route:
- semantic: the answer is in advisory prose and names no specific package, \
version or advisory ("which advisories involve prototype pollution?", \
"how do ReDoS attacks on URL routers work?").
- relational: a crisp graph question about named packages, versions or \
advisories. Set `pattern`:
  - exposure: whether / how a named project or version is exposed to \
vulnerabilities, optionally a named one ("is express@4.17.1 exposed to \
CVE-2024-45296?", "what vulnerabilities are in axios@0.21.1's tree?").
  - affected_projects: which projects or versions a named advisory affects \
("which projects are affected by CVE-2022-0155?").
  - dependency_path: how one named package reaches another through \
dependencies ("how does react-scripts depend on json-schema?").
  - remediation: how to fix or get rid of vulnerable dependencies of a \
named project, optionally a named advisory or dependency ("how do I fix \
CVE-2022-0155 in axios@0.21.1?", "what should mocha 8.4.0 upgrade to drop \
its vulnerable minimatch?").
  - neighbors: one direct relation of a named node; set `relation` too \
("what version fixes GHSA-...?" -> FIXED_IN, "who maintains qs?" -> \
MAINTAINED_BY, "when is CVE-X exploitable?" -> EXPLOITABLE_WHEN).
- graph_guided_hybrid: names a package, version or advisory, but wants an \
explanation from advisory text rather than a graph fact ("what kinds of \
vulnerabilities has lodash had?", "how could an attacker exploit the \
vulnerable packages in express@4.17.1?").

Relation vocabulary (only these values for `relation`):
{relations}

entities: every package, version or advisory id named in the question, \
copied as written: keep "name@version" together and keep CVE/GHSA ids \
whole. For dependency_path and remediation, list the project first and \
the dependency second. Empty list if none.
reasoning: one sentence.

Return only a JSON object with keys "route", "entities", "pattern" (one of \
{", ".join(PATTERNS)}, or null), "relation" (a relation name above, or \
null) and "reasoning"."""
