"""Layer an uploaded package-lock.json over the corpus graph.

The upload's versions and DEPENDS_ON edges go into a graph.overlay store on
top of the corpus graph, plus HAS_VULNERABILITY edges from matching each
installed version against the advisories already in the graph (the same
OSV range matching as vulnerabilities.build_vulnerability_edges). Exposure
and remediation then run unchanged, scoped to the upload's own lockfile
doc id.

A corpus lockfile's root entry is a scratch project that installed one
corpus package, so its dependencies are not edges. An upload's root entry
is the user's own project: its dependencies, devDependencies included, are
the direct edges, and remediation edits its package.json rather than
upgrading it.

Coverage: advisories were fetched from OSV for the corpus's exact
(name, version) pairs. Any other version is matched against the advisories
we hold for its package, but OSV may know more, so it is unchecked. Given
an OsvClient, the unchecked versions are queried live: advisories not in
the graph are added to the overlay (node, AFFECTS_VERSION_RANGE, FIXED_IN)
and matched by our own range matching against every upload version, the
same as the corpus build. OSV's own matches are only a cross-check.
