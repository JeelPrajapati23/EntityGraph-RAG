"""Run a classified DepGraph query against the graph, the advisory index, or both.

Glue only: every retrieval step is an existing function (graph/exposure.py,
GraphStore.neighbors, retrieval/windows.search_chunks). Result rows carry
the node ids, paths and provenance that answer synthesis needs, so it never
has to query the graph again.

A project is a PackageVersion. Walks from it are scoped to one lockfile:
its own if it is a corpus root, otherwise each lockfile it is installed in.
A bare package name ("express") means its corpus-root versions if any,
else every version in a tree.
